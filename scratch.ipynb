Your task is to determine whether the second sentence conveys either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target.  A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people.

A question belongs to the description category if it asks about description and abstract concepts. Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as Human. Quantity questions are asking about numeric values and Location questions ask about locations, cities, and countries.

One of them is created by paraphrasing the original one, with changes on an aspect, or using synonyms. Your task is to decide what is the difference between two sentences. Types of change are explained below:\\n Tense: The verbs in the sentence are changed in tense.\\nNumber: Plural nouns, verbs and pronouns are changed into single ones or the other way around.\\nVoice: If the verbs are in active voice, they're changed to passive or the other way around.\\nAdverb: The paraphrase has one adverb or more than the original sentence.\\nGender: The paraphrase differs from the original sentence in the gender of the names and pronouns.\\nSynonym: Some words or phrases of the original sentence are replaced with synonym words or phrases. Changes in the names of people are also considered a synonym change. Classify your answers into Tense, Number, Voice, Adverb, Gender, and Synonym.\\n\\nInput: original sentence: Jim yelled at Kevin because he was so upset . paraphrase: Jim violently yelled at Kevin because he was so upset .\\nOutput: Adverb\\n\\nDefinition: Answer the question in German.\\n\\nInput: How are you?\\nOutput:\"]\n",

      " Tense: The verbs in the sentence are changed in tense.\n",
      "Number: Plural nouns, verbs and pronouns are changed into single ones or the other way around.\n",
